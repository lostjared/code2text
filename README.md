Code2Text: A Random Text Generator for AI-Driven Image Creation

Code2Text is a specialized tool developed in Rust, designed to generate random sequences of words from blocks of text. This utility is particularly useful for creating diverse and unique inputs for text-to-image AI software, facilitating the generation of random images based on textual descriptions. By extracting and recombining text in novel ways, Code2Text provides a creative toolset for expanding the range of generated imagery.

Getting Started:

To utilize Code2Text, first ensure that the Rust compiler toolchain is installed on your system. Once set up, navigate to the code2text subdirectory to begin using or building the tool with cargo. This process equips users with the ability to produce imaginative and varied text inputs, ready to inspire visually creative outputs from any text-to-image AI platform.

install rust compiler toolchain 
enter code2text subdirectory
and use

    $ cargo build --release
