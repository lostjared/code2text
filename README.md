## Overview
`code2text` is a versatile tool designed to generate random words from text files or source code. It provides a wide range of options to customize the output based on your specific needs, including filtering by word length, selecting words with underscores, and output customization.

## Installation
Clone the repository and build the project using Rust's package manager, Cargo.

```bash
git clone https://example.com/code2text.git
cd code2text
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be located in `./target/release/`.

## Usage

### Advanced Options
`code2text` supports several command-line options to fine-tune its behavior:

- `-i filename.txt`: Specify the input filename. If omitted, `code2text` reads from STDIN.
- `-u`: Only include words that contain underscores.
- `-n`: Set the number of words to find.
- `-l`: Specify the minimum length of words to include.
- `-m`: Set the maximum length of words to include.
- `-o`: Output the result to a specified filename. By default, the output is printed to STDOUT.
- `-s`: Sort the output list of words.
- `-g`: Specify a filename for the output log.
- `-w`: List all collected words before generating the output.
- `-r`: Replace text in the input file with collected words (advanced usage; see below for examples).

### Examples
Generate 10 random words of at least 5 characters from `words.txt` and sort them:

```bash
./code2text -i words.txt -n 10 -l 5 -s
```

## Advanced Text Replacement
The `-r` option allows you to replace placeholders in your text with the words generated by `code2text`. Placeholders should be formatted as `%1`, `%2`, etc., in your text file.

For example:

```bash
./code2text -i input.txt -r template.txt -n 5 -o replaced.txt
```

This command will replace placeholders in `template.txt` with 5 random words from `input.txt` and save the result to `replaced.txt`.
